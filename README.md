# phpuush

So, you're probably confused as to what this is. Well, it's a proxy for puush. The developers for puush decided to be all stupid and refused to implement useless features like SFTP and FTP.

So, my absolutely brilliant friend [jannispl](https://github.com/jannispl) decided to write a new [proxy](https://github.com/jannispl/puushproxy) for puush in node.js. This, as far as we know, was the first alternative implementation of puush.

However, I wanted to experiment in the joys that is hiphop-php. So, I made this! It was designed on Apache, tested on nginx and compiled with hiphop-php.

I think I'm one of the only people in the world apart from Facebook using hiphop-php in a product environment, as it may seem.

# Oh. Okay. What do I do next?

Get around to rewriting this some time
