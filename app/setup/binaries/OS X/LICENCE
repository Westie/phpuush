The puush app does not come with a licence. It does not even state on the site that reverse engineering/modifing the binary is prohibited.

So, here is my take on things:

 - I do not take possession for any changes to this file
 - The creators (IE, the puush team) still own both puush and puush-original

I however believe that they cannot ask me to remove these files.
If they do ask, then more fool them.
